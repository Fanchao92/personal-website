Hello! Welcome to the git repository of my first personal website. Since this is the first independent website I built, I 
complicated the website in that I used NodeJS as the backend to feed data from a MongoDB database back to the user via some APIs. So, at 
the client side, the browser needs to download all the data using AJAX and append the data to the HTML file using JQuery. The UI was 
built with BootStrap, and some customized CSS styles. I know this may be no good to the performance of the website, but all I am trying to
do is to practise all the techniques I've learned so far.

The responsiveness is still a big problem and I'm trying to fix it.

Hi, my name is Fanchao Zhou(周凡超). Welcome to my first personal website!
First, I hope you enjoy the welcome picture on the top. It's my hometown, Zhuhai. The shell-like building in the picture is Zhuhai Opera House located on a small island called Yeli Island(Wild Fox Island, 野狸岛). Last time I went back to Zhuhai, the Opera House was still in construction, but now it's finished! So now you can expect one more tourist attraction to visit when you are having a tour in this beautiful seaside city!
As for me, I've been living in Texas for more than two years and so far everything here is great! I work as a software engineer, and I love coding! In my spare time, I like to watch some movies, whether the latest ones or the classic ones, listen to music, hang out with friends and do some short-distance trips. Though this sounds a little unrealistic for me now, but still, my greatest dream is to travel around the world! I am an introvert person, but please don't take it as 'a shy person'. I'm not shy at all talking to people, I just don't talk as much as an extravert does. So, feel free to contact me! I'm looking forward to talking to you!
